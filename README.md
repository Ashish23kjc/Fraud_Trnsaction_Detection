A machine learning project that detects fraudulent financial transactions using a Random Forest Classifier, and performance improved through threshold tuning. It includes full preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation pipelines using Python and scikit-learn.
## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding transaction patterns
- Random Forest classifier with class weighting
- Threshold tuning for optimal trade-off between precision and recall
- Evaluation using Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, and ROC AUC
## Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
